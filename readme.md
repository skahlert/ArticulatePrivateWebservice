#Articulate Rise (Private) Webservice API
This is a collection of private webservice calls for [Articulate Rise](https://articulate.com/360/rise). Please keep in mind that this is not an officially sanctioned webservice, so Articulate could also decide to close or remove any of the functions at any time in the future. Also, changes to the Articulate Rise backend might break any of the functions and cause data loss in your account.
**Please use with caution!**


#How to use
These functions are supposed to be used with Google Script:
1. Go to the [google script panel](https://script.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Paste the contents of riseApi.js into the newly created script file.
4. Grab the bearer token from a logged in session in rise (more detail will follow)
5. Paste your bearer token at the beginning of the new script.
